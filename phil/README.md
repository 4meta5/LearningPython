## TODO

**PreReqs (surrounding infrastructure)**
* [command line tutorial](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-the-command-line) (very important)
    * download VScode 
        * short cut `command-O` to open file with Finder
        * shortcut `command-H` to open command line
            * [github basics tutorial](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/)
            * commit to github with VScode (without entering password every time)
                * use Keychain to cache password

**Core Tasks** 
* [read and reskim  Zed's intro to instill good habits](https://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/intro.html)
* `Learning Python The Hard Way`
* side projects, frameworks, etc to learn alongside the book

**Eventually**
* [cautionary: don't learn frameworks](https://sizovs.net/2018/12/17/stop-learning-frameworks/) (generalize patterns and don't focus on mastering semantics of specific framework)
* [frameworks](https://hackernoon.com/top-10-python-web-frameworks-to-learn-in-2018-b2ebab969d1a)
    * [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/start/)

### Recommendations

* take notes on whatever you're doing to review on the days in which you only have 15 minutes

* align side projects with what's useful for you: **finance/modeling**, **UELeague**
    * excel scraping and analysis

* subscribe to [learnpython subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/)
    * [`python`](https://www.reddit.com/r/python)
